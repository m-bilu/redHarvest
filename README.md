# Project Red Harvest

---

### Introduction

To build a social media management platform capable of connecting with multiple accounts on multiple various social media platforms, providing insights and analytics to help in decision-making, growth tracking and performance evaluation.
- Three levels of insights; Classical, Shallow ML, Deep ML + LLM stuff (generative/suggestive)
    - Classical:
        - Follow/like/comment counts, top comments of recent posts, list + ability to add/remove followers/liked post lists, ability to mass DM/mass post from within the app (if you want to post same reel on insta reels + tiktok + youtube reels), more ideas to come, tracking revenue from each source, tracking response times to comments/dms/copyright strikes, etc.
    - Shallow ML: ARIMA model to predict likes/follower growth, suggested accounts to connect with, time-to-post suggestions, etc.
    - Deep ML: creators in your space (suggestions), content suggestions, etc.
- Will combine analytics across accounts
- Priced with stages, marketing strategy? Targeted towards micro-influencers, independent parties.
